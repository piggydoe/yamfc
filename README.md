# yamfc
Yamfc (yet another fov circle) is an fov circle that was made by me because i was browsing GitHub for an fov circle made in python (to skid). Not wanting to make one with opengl i decided to make it with tkinter, understandbly the performance may not be as great. Free to use and distribute. THIS IS AN OVERLAY AND DOES NOT GRANT ANY ADVANTAGE!
